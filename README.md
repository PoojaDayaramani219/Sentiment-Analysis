# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning that focuses on determining the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text. It aims to automatically analyze and categorize the sentiment expressed in a given text as positive, negative, neutral

# Process
The process of sentiment analysis typically involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection
2. Text Preprocessing : Clean and preprocess the text data to remove irrelevant information, special characters, punctuation, and convert the text to lowercase. 
3. Feature Extraction
4. Model Selection : Choose an appropriate machine learning model for sentiment analysis. 
5. Model Training and testing
6. Inference: After obtaining a satisfactory model, use it to predict the sentiment of data.

# Pre-requisites
Your laptop with 3.6.x (onwards) installed.

NOTE: Those with Linux and MacOSX would have Python installed by default, no action required.

Windows: Download the version for your laptop via https://www.python.org/downloads/

# Notes
In your preferred editor, make sure indentation is set to "4 spaces". This code has been implemented in jupyter notebook.

# Install the following python packages for successful implementation
--> Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system before running the below commands.

1. pip install nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) - NLTK is a library for natural language processing tasks. It contains various tools, corpora, and models for tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, sentiment analysis, etc.

2. pip install wordcloud - WordCloud is a library for creating word clouds, which are visual representations of text data where the most frequent words appear larger.

3. pip install seaborn - Seaborn is a data visualization library based on matplotlib. 

4. pip install textblob - TextBlob is a simple NLP library built on top of NLTK and provides a higher-level API for common NLP tasks.

5. pip install cufflinks - Cufflinks is a library that connects Pandas and Plotly, making it easy to create interactive visualizations directly from Pandas dataframes.

6. pip install plotly - 'plotly.subplots' and 'plotly.graph_objects' modules provide additional functionality for creating subplots and customizing Plotly-based visualizations.

7. pip install numpy - NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

8. pip install pandas - Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library.

These libraries are commonly used for various data analysis, visualization, and natural language processing tasks.

Note - 
The re(Regular Expressions) module provides support for regular expressions, which are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation.
